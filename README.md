# Customer Mood Analyzer
This Flask app analyzes customer messages to detect their mood—Happy, Neutral, or Angry/Frustrated—and generates polite, professional responses using Google Gemini AI.
It uses TextBlob for sentiment analysis and keyword detection to ensure accurate mood recognition, making it a simple yet effective tool for customer support automation.
